#all code here is not to be run, nor is it in any kind of polished state; it is mostly here for practice, repetition, muscle memory, building familiarity, and hopefully some actual practice getting used to thinking with the syntax and the logic.

#this is essentially like my personal coding wordvomit journal, but it shows I've done "something" right?

Section 1:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
return 0;
}

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
cout << "Hello, World!";
cout << " This " << "is" << " awesome!";
return 0;
}
//prints "hello world" and "this is awesome"

/*this is a multi-line comment */

int a;
int b = 42;

a = 23;
b = 6;

cout << "Please enter a number \n";
cin >> a;

cout << "Enter another number \n";
cin >> b;

cout << b + a;
cout << "that is the sum of a and b, the first and second numbers you entered"
int sum = a + b;
cout << sum << " << << see? that is the sum!

auto l = 5; //int
auto g = 4.32 //float
auto h = "stressfreelife" //string

valid operators: [+-/*%]
parentheses are completed first; multiplication is completed before addition.

+= and -= are increment and decrement operators, which allow you to change the value of a variable in less keystrokes than you might otherwise use. You can use the same shorthand for the other operators: *= /= %=

similarly: you can use x++ [x = x + 1]

relatedly, again, there are postfix and prefix ways of doing this; that is: ++x and x++
"prefix increments the value and then proceeds with the expression."
"postfix evaluates the expression and then performs the incrementing."

pretty cool.

same with decrements;
